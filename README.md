Hi guys i started this series to cement my knowledge in python whilst still climbing up my ladder to python. 

Day 1: simple calculator app using for loops and x, y, z variables

Day 2: File Organizer using for loops and try and except statements. designed to help sort photos and videos that i collected from my iphone. Success!

Day 3: Safe_fileorganizer using loops, try and excepts and inputs to decide safely on files to skip and ones to delete, i wanted to make it also delete empty folders but that was a bit too tricky for me I'd fix it when i revisit this project after this series
Day 4: Contact_book using dictionaries and while loop as well as clever use of pyperclip. the program helps organise contacts name and number and neatly assembles it into a txt file.
