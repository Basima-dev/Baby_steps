Hi guys i started this series to cement my knowledge in python whilst still climbing up my ladder to python. 

Day 1: simple calculator app using for loops and x, y, z variables
Day 2: File Organizer using for loops and try and except statements. designed to help sort photos and videos that i collected from my iphone. Success!
